# Thingo.io Arduino Yun Example

This example demonstrates how to connect Arduino Yun to Thingo.io 

## Hardware preparation

In this demo, we are using a servo motor and Arduino Yun.

Servo motors have three wires: power, ground, and signal. The power wire is typically red, and should be connected to the 5V pin on the Yun board. The ground wire is typically black or brown and should be connected to a ground pin on the board. The signal pin is typically yellow or orange and should be connected to pin 9 on the board.
